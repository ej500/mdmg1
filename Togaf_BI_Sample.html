      <h3>About the TOGAF<sup>®</sup> Series Guides</h3>
      <p>The TOGAF<sup>®</sup> Series Guides contain guidance on how to use the TOGAF Standard and how to adapt it to fulfill specific needs.</p>
      <p>The TOGAF<sup>®</sup> Series Guides are expected to be the most rapidly developing part of the TOGAF Standard and are positioned as the guidance part of the standard. While the TOGAF Fundamental Content is expected to be long-lived and stable, guidance on the use of the TOGAF Standard can be industry, architectural style, purpose, and problem-specific. For example, the stakeholders, concerns, views, and supporting models required to support the transformation of an extended enterprise may be significantly different than those used to support the transition of an in-house IT environment to the cloud; both will use the Architecture Development Method (ADM), start with an Architecture Vision, and develop a Target Architecture on the way to an Implementation and Migration Plan. The TOGAF Fundamental Content remains the essential scaffolding across industry, domain, and style.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The BI &amp; Analytics capability refers to the people, processes, organizations, and systems put together to create value-added information from relevant decision-making data of the organization. This capability breaks applicative data siloes and allows the structuring and leveraging of data according to decision-making and analytics use-cases. It includes business value, data quality, availability, and security to deliver the required common data to relevant reporting or analytics use-cases.</p>
      <p>This capability is founded on reference business functions and reference application functions. This chapter covers the high-level functions reference model, and their definitions. More detailed functions are available in the dedicated reference model part of this document; see Sections <a href="#_Ref70065435">4.2</a> and <a href="#_Ref104902485">4.3</a>.</p>

      <p>Looking back at the history of BI &amp; Analytics on the market, different architecture pattern styles and technical solutions have been used. For a given organization, the coexistence of several BI &amp; Analytics capabilities using different technologies and duplicating data comes with difficulties if the following principles quoted in the TOGAF Standard [<a href="#RefC220">C220</a>] are not respected:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Principle 11: Data is Shared</li>
      <p>Users have access to the data necessary to perform their duties; therefore, data is shared across enterprise functions and organizations (…) It is less costly to maintain timely, accurate data in a single application, and then share it, than it is to maintain duplicative data in multiple applications.</p>
      <p>For a given Organization Information System having the data kept first in an “Infocenter” and then copied in a “data warehouse” for other analytics is costly and complex.</p>
        <li>Principle 20: Control Technical Diversity</li>
      <p>Technological diversity is controlled to minimize the non-trivial cost of maintaining expertise in and connectivity between multiple processing environments.</p>
      <p>For a given Organization Information System maintaining both data warehouse running on Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Data Lake on Hadoop<sup>®</sup> comes with IT cost and complexity that should be justified with business value.</p>
  </ul>
      <p>This section describes an approach to ensure that when a new technology/pattern is introduced for the BI &amp; Analytics, the replacement of the legacy architecture by the new one is performed. Replacing a capability that is paid and up-and-running in an organization is never straightforward as it requires investment that is not easy to justify from a business point of view. This approach is agnostic of the technical solutions.</p>
      <p>The example below deals with the shift from an enterprise data warehouse running on a relational database to new generation BI &amp; Analytics data platforms that deliver the possibility to support volume x variety x velocity needs both for data storage (structured, unstructured, evens, etc.) and for data processing (file processing, <a href="#_Glossary">SQL</a>, graph processing, streams processing, machine learning, etc.).</p>
      <p>Four Transition Architectures are described below.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Concerning data historically imported into the data warehouse, and also to the new generation BI &amp; Analytics data platforms, the preferred approach is not to feed the data warehouse with the new generation BI &amp; Analytics data platforms but for the <a href="#_Glossary">data mart</a> to go directly to Step 4 (nevertheless, this approach might be justified in some cases)
        </li>
        <li>
          In that step, data marts and applications are unplugged from the enterprise data warehouse to new generation BI &amp; Analytics data platforms in an opportunistic and/or step-by-step approach, like “Data Mart #3” in <a href="#_Ref132204171">Figure 4</a>
        </li>
      <p>In this transition step, some may now be fed by both the new generation BI &amp; Analytics data platform and the enterprise data warehouse, like “Transactional Application #1” in <a href="#_Ref115355611">Figure 5</a></p>
        <li>Data flows from transactional applications to the new generation BI &amp; Analytics data platforms are different from those feeding the enterprise data warehouse, as they extract:</li>
      <ul>
      <p style="margin-left:50px;">—&nbsp; Raw data from the transactional application</p>
      <p style="margin-left:50px;">—&nbsp; All the metadata from the transactional application including foreign keys, data dictionary</p>
      <p style="margin-left:50px;">Such information is rarely explicit in the flow feeding the data warehouse. Indeed, that metadata may not be required in the data warehouse as some of this information is kept in the data warehouse modeling.</p>
      <p style="margin-left:50px;">—&nbsp; All available data on a given business object, like a customer or a contract</p>
      <p style="margin-left:50px;">This is not limited to the scope of data required by the analytic use-case. This approach is a default one on the new generation BI &amp; Analytics data platforms, and is allowed because of the low data cost storage.</p>
      </ul>
        <li>The new generation BI &amp; Analytics data platforms act as the persistent raw data historical storage and information and knowledge preparation for the data warehouse replacing staging area or Operational Data Store (ODS)</li>
        <li>The opportunity of this Transition Architecture has to be checked against going directly to Step 4</li>

      <p>Step 4 is the proposed final target for a BI &amp; Analytics capability. Steps 2 and 3 are possible Transition Architectures, but each organization will have to define its own Transition Architecture(s) when designing the level of its roadmap.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the journey from Step 1 to Step 4 might be quite different depending on the current state of the organization:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When the as-is architecture already includes an enterprise <a href="#_Glossary">data warehouse</a>, the shift from the <a href="#_Glossary">data warehouse</a> as the single point of truth for historical data storage might be longer than in an organization that has no enterprise <a href="#_Glossary">data warehouse</a>, and that will directly build the new generation BI &amp; Analytics Target Architecture
        </li>
        <li>Not all organizations will be able to complete the journey within three years, but within five years the new generation BI &amp; Analytics architecture should have taken a significant place in the architecture as the single point of truth for historical data storage</li>

Under no circumstances will the data sharing principle cause confidential data to be compromised.</p>

      <p>To complement this document, a spreadsheet file with an example requirements list for a BI &amp; Analytics capability is provided.</p>
      <p>The architecture requirements listed in this file give some details about the application functions that are described in the reference architecture.</p>
      <p>It should probably not be read as a whole, but can be a reference to find details on some functions.</p>

          <td class="tableblock">
            <p><strong>Architecture Requirements</strong></p>
            <p>The Enterprise Architecture systemic approach is applied here. The whole scope of work is a system composed of subsystems. Each function constitutes a subsystem. Thereby, the requirement wording “the system” refers to the function of the requirement.</p>
            <p>They are provided in the spreadsheet file by the functions listed and here, in this chapter, they are provided in alphabetical order.</p>
            <p>The architecture requirements represent formal statements of need, as expressed by stakeholders, which must be met by the architecture.</p>
            <p>Architecture requirements capture what is architecturally significant or, in other words, they should capture what has an impact on the architecture decisions. They should not be as detailed as specification or test requirements, but can be an input to writing them.</p>
            <p>By formal statements we mean:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Explicit and understandable need</li>
              <li>Not solution-oriented, no tooling name</li>
              <li>Atomic</li>
              <li>Unique</li>
              <li>Verifiable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The architecture requirements are synthetic but detailed enough to allow:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clear understanding of the capabilities needed and delivered</li>
              <li>Roadmap prioritization</li>
            <p>—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Securing of the implementation of the BI &amp; Analytics platform</p>
              <li>Architecture decisions</li>
              <li>Precise understanding of the capabilities provided by IT suppliers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The formalization of requirements uses the following structure: “The system should [verb][object][stakeholder]”.</p>

A raw copy of the mainframe operational systems data was made available for analytics by business users. It was then replaced by data warehouses, but they are still used and in place in some organizations.

      </td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">A database designed to integrate data from multiple sources for additional operations on the data. Unlike a master data store, the data is not passed back to operational systems. It may be passed for further operations and to the data warehouse for reporting. Because the data originates from multiple sources, the integration often involves cleaning, resolving redundancy, and checking against business rules for integrity. It is usually designed to contain low-level or atomic (indivisible) data (such as transactions and prices) with limited history that is captured in “real time” or “near-real time” as opposed to the much greater volumes of data stored in the data warehouse generally on a less-frequent basis. The general purpose is to integrate data from disparate source systems in a single structure, using data integration technologies like data virtualization, data federation, or ETL. This will allow operational access to the data for operational reporting, master data, or reference data management. It is not a replacement or substitute for a data warehouse, but can be a source.

      </td><td style="vertical-align:top;">An intermediate storage area used for data processing during the ETL process. The data staging area sits between the data source(s) and the data target(s), which are often data warehouses, data marts, data lakes, or other data repositories. Data staging areas are often transient in nature, with their contents being erased prior to running an ETL process or immediately following successful completion of an ETL process.
