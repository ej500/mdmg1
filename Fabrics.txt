### Data Integration
#### Azure Data Factory 
##### ADF is the successor of SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)
##### ETL for professionals 
##### power to transfer billions and trillions of rows of data
####   Dataflow
#####  Transformation engine  simplified for analysts 
#####  Buildt on enhancements in Power Query technology
#####  Used alongside ADF
### Data Engineering
#### Synapse 
##### Build infrastructure using Lakehouse (OneLake)
##### Build pipelines to ingest  data
##### Include Connectors to various sources
##### Shortcuts or ADF to move data into Lakehouse

### Data Warehousing
#### Large Scale DWH
#### Query powered by SQL Thecnology or Spark 
##### SQL Thecnology 
##### Apache Spark
###### Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)
###### Kusto is used for interacting with this technolog
###### No need to use a separate tool or editor
###### Allows integration to other providers as as well 

####  Infinitely scalable DWH

#####  data warehouse developer or admin do not need to scale up or down
#####  ability to handle varying volumes of data and workloads efficiently
#####  scale up or down as per the data processing needs
#####  suitable for both small-scale and large-scale data operations.
#####  complex queries without compromising on performance,

#### Synapse Open DWH
##### various data formats
##### various processing languages
##### Flexible data storage systems.
######  Data can be stored in an open format parquet file.
- Parquet file offers a system-independent way to store data in a columnar format
- beneficial for analytical querying and efficient storage.
- can be used across various platforms and services
###### Azure Data Lake Storage
- Large-scale analytics on structured and unstructured data
- Seamless connection with data lakes
###### Azure Blob Storage
- Suitable for massive unstructured data storage
- Blob Storage Connectivity Efficient handling of large data sets
###### Cosmos DB
- Globally distributed, multi-model database service
- Integration support for varied data models
- Low Latency
- Mission Critical 
- Models such as document, key-value, column-family
- API: SQL,MongoDB,Gremlin,Table
- IOT, mobile applications etc
- suitable for horisontal scaling (distribute db load to more nodes)
###### SQL Databases
- Traditional relational data storage and management
- Sql DB compatabillity Smooth integration with relational data systems

### Data Science
#### Synapse
##### Tools for Data Science Projects
- Data Science using Synapse is added as a workload
- Data Science is a combination of features and tools used across the entire MS Fabric
- Data Wrangler
- Synapse ML
- Cognitive Services
- Large language models
- PREDICT

### Synapse Real-time Analytics workload
#### Synapse
##### Handling IOT and Log Analytics
###### IOT Analytics
###### Log Analytics
###### event streaming technologies
- (such as IoT or Event Hubs, pipelines, etc.),
- loading data into KQL DB and Lakehouse via mirroring
- which mean exact copy of data in one environment to another in near-real-time.
- and then ML models to run experiments on it, 
- and finally, use Power BI to see the results.

### Business Intelligence
#### Power BI
##### Direct Lake (New Connection Type)
- Faster than DirectQuery
- Connects directly with one lake ?

### Action Platform
#### Data Activator
##### Automating Actions Based on Data

### Governance
#### Purview
##### Data Governance and Management
##### Scan Entire Microsoft Fabric artifact (Not only PBI)
##### Part of Fabric Portal
##### end-to-end monitoring 
##### and a comprehensive audit log system
